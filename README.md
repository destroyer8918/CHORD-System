# CHORD-System
This project simulates a basic CHORD Distributed Hash Table (DHT) system using Python. The CHORD system allows the addition and deletion of nodes and performs lookups to determine which node is responsible for a given key. This project includes a visualization of the CHORD ring using matplotlib.
